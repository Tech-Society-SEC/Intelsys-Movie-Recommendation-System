## Getting Started  
Since the project starts from scratch, follow these steps to build Nexen:  

1. **Set Up a New React Project**  
   Use Create React App to initialize your project:  
   ```bash  
   npx create-react-app Nexen-movie-recommendation-system  
   ```  

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   ```bash  
   cd Nexen-movie-recommendation-system  
   ```  

3. **Install Dependencies**  
   Add the necessary packages for API calls, routing, and any additional functionalities:  
   ```bash  
   npm install axios react-router-dom  
   ```  

4. **Set Up TMDb API Integration**  
   - Register at TMDb and obtain an API key.  
   - Create a service to fetch movie data (categories, details, ratings).  

5. **Build Frontend Components**  
   - Movie list display.  
   - Movie detail page.  
   - Filters for categories and search options.  

6. **Run the Development Server**  
   ```bash  
   npm start  
   ```  
   Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
